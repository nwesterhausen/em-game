1) Copy your TTF into your project folder
2) You will see Godot import it as a DynamicFontData in the file browser
3) In the inspector click on the "new resource" icon and create a new DynamicFont.
4) In the Font category, click on Font data and choose your TTF
5) Save the DynamicFont under the name you want (optional)
6) You can now use this dynamic font where you want, change its size, spacing etc (without altering the original font).


Note that the default size when you create a DynamicFont is 0, so your text is just a few dots if you don't set the size!
