# Elemental Master

A magic-shooting arpg focused on environmental interaction.

## About

The original idea surfaced in a 2D platformer I was working on with a friend, probably back in 2005. The idea of that game 
was that you were a wizard and could switch elements to cast a different spell and that would interact with the level or
emenies in different ways. Ultimately, development puttered out and the files were lost to time (but remembered).

Then a couple years ago I started a rework of the game and wrote up some design documents on how it could work as an 2D 
arpg-style game focused on the wizard from before, but now you really were master of the elements. Choose 1 or 2 elements
to be master of and then you're able to use those in spells. Try to clear the levels in the fastest time, and most of the
strategy would come from choosing elements that work well on the layout of levels.

The development on that game came to a halt when it came to implementing the spell-casting. I had started out at too high-
level and there was nothing at a low-level to support the ideas I wanted to do.

Finally, queue January 2021 when I finally decided to try again at this idea. This time I started with the part that killed
me last time and wrote a grid handler to work in the backend. That should facilitate casting magic accurately on the level
as well as keeping enemy and player movement within bounds and predictable.
